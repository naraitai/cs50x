            <h2>The Power of Vocabulary Frequency</h2>
        </div>

        <div class = "article-body">
            <p>While grammar is the skeleton, vocabulary is the flesh of a language. No surprise then that the perennial question on a language student’s mind is: how should I learn
               vocabulary. But more fundamental still is the question: How to choose the words to learn? The answer is vocabulary frequency.</p>
            <p>The methods for learning vocabulary are many and varied, but there is only one thing you need for a solid vocabulary study strategy: frequency.</p>
            <p>A focus on frequency is essential for a practical vocabulary in any foreign language. Let’s look at the research to decide what this means for you as a learning
               and how you can harness the power of frequency.</p>

            <h3>Finding Vocabulary</h3>
            <image src = "images/Findind Vocabular - VCW(10)2.jpg" class = "article-jpg"></image>
            <p>There are several schools of thought on how choose vocabulary to learn in your target language.</p>

            <h4>The Traditionalist</h4>
            <p>This method is most familiar from school where you were instructed to learn word lists supplied by a teacher or lifted from a textbook.</p>
            <p>The question is, are these words actually useful?</p>
            <p>For Japanese, Genki is a great example of this approach. Genki 1 and 2 are great textbooks, but they are made for university students.</p>
            <p>But I and many others started studying Japanese while working, which significantly decreases the number of conversations about your university major.</p>
            <p>It is not so much a question of whether it is useful to know these words, rather it is a question of timing.</p>
