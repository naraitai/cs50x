// Recover
** Take a recovery file
** Find the images
** Store each image in a new file numbered based on number of image.

// Check and open
Take 1 command line argument only
Test for if file can't be opened

open file.
Look for a Jpeg
Open new jpg file - FILE *f = fopen(FILE, MODE);
Write file into that jpg file
Continue until end of file


Generate .jpg file numbered for number of image.

JPEG has a header - 0xFF / 0xD8 / 0xFF / 0xe? (1 to F)
Stored back to back
Each block is 512 bytes

Find header write to file
Find another close old open new

fread(POINTER, SIZE, NUMBER, INPTR);
buffer[0] == 0xFF etc

bitwise arithmetic (buffer[3] & 0xF0) == 0xe0

sprintf(filename, "%03i.jpg", 2(NUMBER TO SUBSTITUTE INTO NAME);

filename needs enough memory to contain it (malloc)

FILE *img = fopen(filename, "w");

fwrite(DATA, SIZE, NUMBER, OUTPTR);

fread at end of file or not.

Pseudocode

^ Check command line arguments
^ Open file
^ Check file opens correctly

^ create block data type
^ creat buffer of size block

^ Repeat until end
    ^ Read 512 bytes into buffer
    ^ If first byte is 0xFF and if 2nd byte it 0xD8 and if 3rd byte is 0xFF and if 4th byte is bitwise arithmetic 0xE0 start of new JPEG
   ^ jpg counter
        ^If JPEG counter is 1
            ^write new file name
            ^ open file
            ^ write buffer into file
        Else
            ^ close old file
            ^write new file name
            ^open new file
            ^write buffer into file
    Else
        If jpq counter is greater than 0
            Keep writing to JPEG (could be multiple blocks)
Close all files
