// Grayscale
** Take an image.
** Loop through each pixel.
** Computer average RGB value per pixel.
** Set RGB values to the respecting average value.

for every row
    for every column
        round red value plus green value plus blue value divided by 3
        set image red value to average
        set image green value to average
        set image blue value to average


// Reflect
** Take an image
** Loop through each pixel up to middway point
** Swap that pixel with opposite number

for every row
    for every column up to middway
        temporarily store the pixel
        overwrite pixel with that of opposite number
        overwrite opposite number with temporarily stored pixel


// Blur
** Take an image
** Loop through each pixel
** Calculate average of each colour value for every pixel within a column and a row
** Apply each of those averages to original image

for every row
    for every column
        add pixel to copy of image

for every row
    for every column
        count pixels

// Edge
** Take an image
** Detect and highlight edges between
items in the image
